        "The spaces made for homecomings are open-ended, no bars to separate those who arrive and those who wait... as if to say belonging is assumed, no boundary to cross.",

        "This sliver of eternity held in sightline, tracing the shadow as it becomes the gait, as it approaches and steps out of my imagination... my vision manifest, the picture sharpened to presence.",
        "Those thoughts that press against the mindâ€™s edge... my future arriving in whispers that sear, murmuring hopes... seething and bleeding into the moments that follow.",
        "This record pressed into existence, my life written onto skin, into prints... each mark a small testament, as though my words might hold permanence in their own erasure.",
        "I attempt closure with finality, the insistence that this is the end of it... yet, every ending is only an ellipsis in disguise, words waiting to circle back.",
        "A dim glow that touches all things yet reveals nothing fully... the half-lit world, shadows filling in the blanks where detail fades, where light gives way to longing.",
        "The iron bars are both separator and sanctum... each visit, a ritual of restraint and expectancy... this is my threshold, holding me back and holding me steady.",
        "Words pulled close, narrowed to a pinpoint of focus... every line straining to see clearer, though always, a blur remains... the ache of seeing just short of knowing."
